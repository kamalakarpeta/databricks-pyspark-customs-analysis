# PySpark Customs Data Analysis on Databricks

**Description:**

Developed and implemented a scalable data processing and analysis pipeline using PySpark on Databricks to analyze large datasets from the Datamyne customs database. This project facilitated a deep understanding of international trade patterns, company-level import/export transactions, and commodity flows. The processed and analyzed data was then ingested into the Orbis database, enhancing its customs-related information for customers. This project optimized Databricks compute resources, workflows, and data lineage options to ensure efficient and reliable data processing.

**Key Technologies:**

* Databricks (Apache Spark, Delta Lake)
* PySpark (Spark SQL, Spark DataFrames)
* SQL (Databricks SQL, Orbis Database)
* Datamyne Database
* Databricks Workflows and Data Lineage
* Cloud Storage: **AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage**
* Notebooks: **Jupyter/Databricks Notebooks**
* Version Control: **Git**

**Project Overview:**

* **Data Ingestion:** Extracted large datasets from the Datamyne database and ingested them into Databricks using efficient data connectors.
* **Data Transformation:** Employed PySpark and Delta Lake to perform complex data transformations, aggregations, and cleaning operations, preparing the data for analysis.
* **Data Analysis:** Utilized Spark SQL and Spark DataFrames to analyze trade flows between countries and companies, identify key imported/exported commodities, and derive meaningful insights from the customs data.
* **Compute Resource Optimization:** Optimized Databricks compute resources by tuning Spark configurations, selecting appropriate cluster types, and implementing efficient data partitioning strategies.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Developed and implemented Databricks Workflows to automate the data processing pipeline, ensuring reliable and repeatable execution.
* **Data Lineage Tracking:** Leveraged Databricks data lineage capabilities to track data transformations and dependencies, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
* **Data Ingestion into Orbis:** Successfully ingested the processed and analyzed data into the Orbis database, enriching customer profiles with comprehensive customs information.
* **Cloud Storage Integration:** Utilized cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) to store and manage large datasets, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Key Achievements:**
